# It's all fun and games
I'm a third year Game Design and Development student attending the Rochester Institute of Technology. I enjoy turning a simple game idea into a flushed out user experience. If I'm not behind a computer crunching code or running raids with my clan, you can find me outside protecting the hoops for our school's Quidditch team.
